# Fraunces Minisite Specimen

## Project setup & development

This project requires Node.js >= 12 and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and is based on [Specimen Skeleton](https://github.com/kabisa/specimen-skeleton).

To get started, run the following commands from the root of the repo:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` - this will start the local development server, view at http://localhost:8080.

The site will [automatically](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) be re-built and deployed on Github Pages every time the master branch is updated.
