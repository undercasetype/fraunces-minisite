		<h2>Meet Fraunces, an “Old Style” typeface</h2>

		<p>
			In the summer of 2018, Google Fonts approached us with the challenge
			of designing a display typeface. We spent some time perusing the
			catalog, and were struck by a pretty big gap in the typographic
			voices available. There isn’t a specific name for this genre, but
			typefaces such as Cooper Black, Windsor, and Souvenir personify it.
			We call them “wonky” fonts in-house, and that seems as good a name
			as any. We’ve played a lot with this style in our lettering work,
			and felt this was a great opportunity to create a typeface family
			that celebrates the genre.

			The origin of “wonky” fonts traces its roots back to the Arts and
			Crafts experimentations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
			centuries. Golden Type by William Morris, and the extensive
			lettering of the Roycroft Guild drew upon a heavily romanticized
			ideal of an “Old Style” that their progress-besotted contemporaries
			had lost touch with. Morris’ Golden Type was an extremely crude
			interpretation of the types of fifteenth-century printer Nicolas
			Jenson, opting instead to emphasize the perceived effects of the
			printing process, rather than the calligraphic origins of the form.

			Ironically, the letters these artists created, and the interest in
			wonky Old Style typefaces that followed it in subsequent
			decades—heavy-hitting display typeface favorites like Cooper Black
			by Ozwald Cooper, Windsor by Eleisha Pechey, or Clearface by Morris
			Fuller Benton/Linn Boyd Benton—had little or nothing to do with
			typefaces of antiquity. No one was really trying to score points for
			rigorous historical authenticity.

			Instead, these typefaces were playful, even outright goofy, a way to
			inject some personality into modernity. Even during this era, types
			like Richardson Old Style by Robert DeLittle showcased some of the
			more elegant possibilities of this expressive approach.

			During the 1970s, graphic designers were raiding style books and
			publications of earlier generations for looking for more funky
			stylings, and found a treasure trove in the “Old Style” types of the
			era. The irreverence and friendliness of these typefaces were the
			perfect countercultural antidote to the perceived stuffiness and
			chilly efficiency of traditional text faces. A prime example of this
			style coming out of the ’70s was Ed Benguiat’s swashy version of
			Bookman for ITC. Benguiat’s type was an ode to Oswald Cooper’s
			Cooper Black Italic. It’s known to most people today as the friendly
			typographical wave of the small businessperson to their regular
			customers: the ubiquitous “Thank You For Shopping With Us” that
			graces the sides of grocery bags all over North America.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mostly shunned since the 1990s as being vaguely tasteless and
			disreputable, there’s been a twenty-first century revival of
			interest and use of these typefaces. With the advent of new type
			technology such as variable fonts, it’s a great opportunity to
			update this genre with a typeface family that is made uniquely for
			our time. Please enjoy, and as ever, thank you for shopping with us.
